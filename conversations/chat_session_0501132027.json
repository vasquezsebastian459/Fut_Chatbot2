This indicates that there were no records found in the database for matches between the specified teams under the names 'Team1' and 'Team2'. It's possible that the team names in the query were placeholders and not correctly replaced with 'Manchester United' and 'Manchester City'.\n\nTo provide the correct information, the SQL query should be adjusted to use the actual team names.
